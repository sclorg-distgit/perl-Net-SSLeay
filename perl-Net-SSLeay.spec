%description
This module offers some high level convenience functions for accessing
web pages on SSL servers (for symmetry, same API is offered for
accessing http servers, too), a sslcat() function for writing your own
clients, and finally access to the SSL API of SSLeay/OpenSSL package
so you can write servers or clients for more complicated applications.

  Summary of major changes since version 1.85
  - Mike McCauley has stepped down as maintainer: the new maintainers are Chris
    Novakovic, Heikki Vatiainen and Tuure Vartiainen
  - The source code has moved from the now-defunct Debian Subversion server
    (alioth.debian.org) to GitHub
    (https://github.com/radiator-software/p5-net-ssleay)
  - Net-SSLeay is provided under the terms of the Artistic License 2.0; this
    has been the case since version 1.66, but references to other licenses
    remained in the source code, causing ambiguity
  - Perl 5.8.1 or newer is now required to use Net-SSLeay; this has already
    been the case for some time in practice, as the test suite hasn't fully
    passed on Perl 5.6 for several years
  - Much-improved compatibility with OpenSSL 1.1.1, and improved support for
    TLS 1.3
  - Fixed a long-standing bug in cb_data_advanced_put() that caused memory
    leaks when callbacks were frequently added and removed
  - Support in the test suite for "hardened" OpenSSL configurations that set a
    default security level of 2 or higher (e.g., in the OpenSSL packages that
    ship with recent versions of Debian, Fedora and Ubuntu)

  - Fixed a problem with exporting OPENSSL_NO_NEXTPROTONEG even though they

    LibreSSL does not support these functions, at least yet
  - Add new functions related to SSL_CTX_new
  - Add two new functions introduced in OpenSSL 1.1.0, a number of constants
    and a couple of const qualifiers to SSLeay.xs; tests and documentation .pod
    were also updated

    OpenSSL 1.1.0
  - Fixed LibreSSL version detection to correctly parse LibreSSL minor version
  - Fix memory leaks in OCSP handling

    documentation; the new functions provide access to the built-in wildcard
    check functionality available in OpenSSL 1.0.2 and later
  - Added X509_STORE_CTX_new and X509_verify_cert
  - SSL_OCSP_response_verify now clears the error queue if OCSP_basic_verify
    fails but the intermediate certificate succeeds

* Tue Oct 31 2017 Paul Howarth <paul@city-fan.org> - 1.82-1
- Update to 1.82
  - Added support for building under Linuxbrew (a linuxbrew version of MacOS
    Homebrew)
  - Implement SSL_CTX_set_psk_client_callback() and
    SSL_set_psk_client_callback()
  - Skip the NPN test if the SSL library is LibreSSL
  - Fixed a problem with a variable declaration in
    ssleay_session_secret_cb_invoke
  - Bugfix: tlsext_status_cb_invoke(...): free ocsp_response only when
    allocated; the same callback is used on a server side for OCSP stapling
    and in that case ocsp_response is NULL and not used
  - New feature: Added a binding
    SSL_set_session_ticket_ext_cb(ssl, callback, data); a callback used by
    EAP-FAST/EAP-TEAT to parse and process TLS session ticket
  - New feature: Added a binding SSL_set_session_ticket_ext(ssl, ticket); used
    by EAP-FAST/EAP-TEAP to define TLS session ticket value
  - Bugfix: tlsext_ticket_key_cb_invoke(...): allow SHA256 HMAC key to be 32
    bytes instead of 16 bytes (which OpenSSL will pad with zeros up to 32
    bytes)
  - New feature: Added following bindings:
    - X509_get_ex_data(cert, idx)
    - X509_get_ex_new_index(argl, argp, new_func, dup_func, free_func)
    - X509_get_app_data(cert)
    - X509_set_ex_data(cert, idx, data)
    - X509_set_app_data(cert, arg)
    - X509_STORE_CTX_get_ex_new_index(argl, argp, new_func, dup_func, free_func)
    - X509_STORE_CTX_get_app_data(x509_store_ctx)
    - X509_STORE_CTX_set_app_data(x509_store_ctx, arg)
  - New feature: Added an implementation for
    SSL_get_finished(ssl, buf, count=2*EVP_MAX_MD_SIZE)
  - New feature: Added an implementation for
    SSL_get_peer_finished(ssl, buf, count=2*EVP_MAX_MD_SIZE)
  - Bugfix: SSL_get_keyblock_size(s): Calculate key block size correctly also
    with AEAD ciphers, which don’t use digest functions
  - New feature: Added a binding SSL_set_tlsext_status_ocsp_resp(ssl, staple);
    used by a server side to include OCSP staple in ServerHello
  - Bugfix: SSL_OCSP_response_verify(ssl, rsp, svreq, flags): check that chain
    and last are not NULL before trying to use them
  - Bugfix: inc/Module/Install/PRIVATE/Net/SSLeay.pm: Don’t quote include and
    lib paths
- Drop EL-5 support
  - Drop BuildRoot: and Group: tags
  - Drop explicit buildroot cleaning in %%install section
  - Drop explicit %%clean section

* Tue Jan  3 2017 Paul Howarth <paul@city-fan.org> - 1.79-1

    - Conditionally remove threading locking code, not needed in 1.1
    - Rewrite code that accesses inside X509_ATTRIBUTE struct
    - SSL_CTX_need_tmp_RSA, SSL_CTX_set_tmp_rsa, SSL_CTX_set_tmp_rsa_callback,
      SSL_set_tmp_rsa_callback support not available in 1.1

    - With 1.1, $secret in the session_secret callback set with
      SSL_set_session_secret_cb can be changed to alter the master key
      (required by EAP-FAST)
  - Added a function EC_KEY_generate_key similar to RSA_generate_key and a
    function EVP_PKEY_assign_EC_KEY similar to EVP_PKEY_assign_RSA; using
    these functions it is easy to create and use EC keys in the same way as RSA
    keys

    the stateless TLS session tickets

    http_cat()
  - Removed unnecessary Debian_CPANTS.txt from MANIFEST - again

* Wed Jun 11 2014 Paul Howarth <paul@city-fan.org> - 1.64-1
- Update to 1.64
  - Test ocsp.t now does not fail if HTTP::Tiny is not installed
  - Fixed repository in META.yml
  - Fixed a problem with SSL_get_peer_cert_chain: if the SSL handshake results
    in an anonymous authentication, like ADH-DES-CBC3-SHA, get_peer_cert_chain
    will not return an empty list, but instead return the SSL object
  - Fixed a problem where patch
    https://git.openssl.org/gitweb/?p=openssl.git;a=commit;h=3009244d
    caused a failed test in t/local/33_x509_create_cert.t

* Mon May 19 2014 Paul Howarth <paul@city-fan.org> - 1.63-1
- Update to 1.63
  - Improvements to OCSP support: it turns out that some CAs (like Verisign)
    sign the OCSP response with the CA we have in the trust store and don't
    attach this certifcate in the response, but OpenSSL by itself only
    considers the certificates included in the response and
    SSL_OCSP_response_verify added the certificates in the chain too, so now
    we also add the trusted CA from the store which signed the lowest chain
    certificate, at least if we could not verify the OCSP response without
    doing it

* Sat May 10 2014 Paul Howarth <paul@city-fan.org> - 1.59-1
- Update to 1.59

  - Deleted support for SSL_get_tlsa_record_byname: it is not included in
    OpenSSL git master
- Drop upstreamed patch for CPAN RT#91215
- Skip the Pod Coverage test, as there are naked subroutines in this release
- ECC support not available in Fedora/EL until OpenSSL 1.0.1e, so patch the
  source accordingly to fix builds for F-12 .. F-17

    certificate with values in the CDP extension that do not have an ia5 string
    would cause a segmentation fault when accessed
  - change in t/local/32_x509_get_cert_info.t to not use

  - improvements to Net::SSLeay::read to make it easier to use with
    non-blocking IO: it modifies Net::SSLeay::read() to return the result from

    list context (its behavior should be unchanged if called in scalar or void
    context)
